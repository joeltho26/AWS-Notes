    "    - EC2 instance roles => EC2 instances\n",
    "    - ECS roles => ECS tasks\n",
    "    - Lambda roles => Lambda function\n",
    "- While working outside AWS\n",
    "    - use environment variables/named profile\n",
    "\n",
    "Note:\n",
    "- Even after adding the EC2 instance profiling why did the app have full S3 credentials ?\n",
    "    - because of credentials order i.e. environment variables have high priority to EC2 instance profiling\n",
